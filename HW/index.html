      <p>I am a Chicago native; grew up on the southside and still currently living there. I am most definitely an urban person but enjoy leaving the hustle and bustle when I can. I went to De La Salle High School where I played basketball and football.<br> <br>I recently graduated from Elmhurst College; did not play sports there but I did support my fellow Bluejays! One of my favorite things to do is travel; I hope to make it to Europe in the next year. I also enjoy visiting new restaurants and breweries. I worked for Lagunitas Brewing Company for 5 years. They make my favorite beer but I will drink almost anything except for Miller Lite.<br> <br> I force myself to exercise every now and then. My preferred method is cycling on my peloton; if you peloton, you should follow me and hold me accountable! To relax, I enjoy watching The Office or reading; currently reading Outliers. My favorite video game of all time is Halo 2. I should have gone pro but my parents told me that video games don't pay the bills. They were wrong. All jokes aside, I am extremely excited for the Northwestern Boot Camp and hoping to transition into a role as a Web Developer in 2020. </p>
